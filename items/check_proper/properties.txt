//It's a bit unfortunate that this item doesn't always orient nicely towards a connection on the floor. I am not sure how to implement this without a clunky extra selection item. Maybe if the antline corner was edited something could happen, but that is beyond my area of 'expertise.'

//It is extremely unlikely, but a few authors still use older BEE version, so in the _rare_ case that one of them wants to at least try to use this package, I included the quarter tile models.
